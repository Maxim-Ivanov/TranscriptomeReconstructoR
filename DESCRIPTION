Description: This package reconstructs the most probable gene/transcript model for a species 
    by combining a few orthogonal high throughput sequencing datasets. The three 
    essential datasets are as follows: i) 5' tag RNA sequencing dataset which shows 
    TSS (transcription start sites), e.g. CAGE; ii) 3' tag RNA sequencing dataset 
    which shows PAS (polyadenylation sites); iii) Full-length RNA sequencing dataset 
    which shows splicing patterns (e.g. Direct RNA-seq on Oxford Nanopore). 
    Optionally, a nascent RNA-seq dataset (e.g. NET-seq or GRO-seq) can be added to 
    resolve the transient non-coding transcripts.
